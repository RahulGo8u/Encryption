# Encryption

## Description

Welcome to the **Encryption** repository!

## Available Codes

1. **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: This code demonstrates AES encryption, a widely used symmetric encryption algorithm known for its robust security and efficiency.

2. **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**: Explore DES encryption, a symmetric encryption algorithm that was widely used in the past and played a significant role in data security history.

3. **3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard)**: Get hands-on with 3DES, an enhanced version of DES that provides stronger security through multiple encryption rounds.

4. **Hashing (with and without Salt)**: Discover hashing techniques with and without salt, which are essential for password storage and data integrity verification.

5. **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**: Dive into RSA encryption, an asymmetric algorithm that uses a pair of keys for secure communication and digital signatures.

## Getting Started

To run these encryption and hashing programs, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RahulGo8u/Encryption.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific file of the encryption or hashing method you want to explore.

3. Open the Node.js terminal and run the respective program using the command:
   ```
   node <filename>.js
   ```

4. Observe the output and experiment with different input data to understand the encryption/hashing process.
